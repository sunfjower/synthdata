## Sythdata

Generate realistic mock data for all your testing and development needs. <br><br>

## About the project

A test data generator, also known as a fake data generator or dummy data generator, is a tool for generating realistic synthetic data. If you're developing an application, you'll want to make sure you're testing it under conditions that closely simulate a production environment. In a live setting, your application will face heavy usage from numerous users, which puts a strain on your code. If you manually enter data into a test environment one record at a time through the user interface, you'll never replicate the volume and diversity of data that your app will accumulate in just a few days of production usage. <br><br>
The purpose of the Synthdata pet-project is to accelerate the development and testing phases by providing a streamlined solution for working with mock data. <br><br>

## Usage

Simple steps for utilizing this mock data generator tool:

1. Select the field type based on your data need.
2. Provide the field name. (For instance, if you selected field type \[Name\], <br>
you can enter the field name as \[User_Name\]).
3. Add/Remove button: Add a column in mock dataset.
4. Total Rows: Enter the total number of rows required in mock dataset.
5. Format: Select the mock dataset output format, it can be JSON or CSV.
6. Click Generate button for the download mock dataset.
